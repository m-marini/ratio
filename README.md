**Ratio** is a java application that handles rational numbers and matrices.

Evaluating expressions based on rational numbers and matrices are going to get easy.
For example you can compute the product between a matrix and a vector as

     1  2  3     1       3
     2  3  4  x  1/2  =  29/6
     3  2  1     1/3     203

typing simply

    (1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 4; 3, 4, 5) * (1; 1/2; 1/3)

Most of the algebraic operators are available, such +, -, *, /, operators of composition of matrices and the general functions on matrices such as rank, inverse, determinant, reduction, identity and calculation of basis vectors.

To run **Ratio** you need the Java 1.7 runtime environment installed.

The application installable file are available in https://github.com/m-marini/ratio/wiki/Downloads
