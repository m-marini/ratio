{"name":"Ratio","tagline":"Rational matrix calculator","body":"**Ratio** is a java application that handles rational numbers and matrices.\r\n\r\nEvaluating expressions based on rational numbers and matrices are going to get easy.\r\nFor example you can compute the product between a matrix and a vector as\r\n\r\n     1  2  3     1       3\r\n     2  3  4  x  1/2  =  29/6\r\n     3  2  1     1/3     203\r\n\r\ntyping simply\r\n\r\n    (1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 4; 3, 4, 5) * (1; 1/2; 1/3)\r\n\r\nMost of the algebraic operators are available, such `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, operators of composition of matrices and the general functions on matrices such as rank, inverse, determinant, reduction, identity and calculation of basis vectors.\r\n\r\nTo get details information you can check out the https://github.com/m-marini/ratio/wiki.\r\n\r\nTo run **Ratio** you need the Java 1.7 runtime environment installed.\r\n\r\nThe application installable file are available in https://github.com/m-marini/ratio/wiki/Downloads\r\n\r\n![Ratio application sample image](https://raw.github.com/m-marini/ratio/web-docs/ratio-web-docs/images/ratio-sample.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
